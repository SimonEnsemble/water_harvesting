regarding the paper
> C. Harriman, Q. Ke, T. Vlugt, A. Howarth, C. Simon. "Optimizing the composition of a mixture of metal-organic frameworks for passive atmospheric water harvesting in a defined region and time frame". (2025)

this repo contains the:
* compiled water adsorption isotherm data in the MOFs (see `new/data/*.csv`)
* weather time series data in two regions (see `new/data/NOAA_weather_data`)
* Python code, in a marimo notebook, to completely reproduce our results and figures (see `new/water_harvesting.py`)
